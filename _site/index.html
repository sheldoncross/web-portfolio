                <p class="poppin">
                    Hello,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My name is Stefan (STEF-on) and I'm a recent graduate of Computer Science from 
                    UOIT. I've always been interested in software, since learning how programming 
                    languages were the building blocks behind the games of my childhood I quickly 
                    realized it was possible to make my own games, which meant I would make the 
                    rules and what kid doesn't want to make up their own rules? After realizing 
                    how complex and in-depth the task to recreate Zelda or anything really was I 
                    thought to myself "instead of leveling up my in-game skills, maybe I could 
                    improve real life ones?", which after a few twists and turns has led me to 
                    creating this website to showcase the many skills I've learnt along the way. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The younger me was extremely excited to learn about the underlying 
                    technologies that had defined the era of personal computing that had exploded 
                    all around me. As I started to understand the workings behind the large 
                    personal computers in my own home, computers began to appear outside the world 
                    in mobile devices everywhere and soon they began to become apart of a everday 
                    household items that had until that point had never changed in my life, I 
                    quickly realized with software and computers the possibilities for creativity 
                    were endless. I developed an interest in the technologies that were readily 
                    available to me and were already affecting my life in interesting ways. I 
                    started creating mobile applications that interacted with the products I 
                    purchased, websites for my own personal interests and later on after entering 
                    university, many many school projects. These experiences taught me languages far 
                    different than what I had known before and also industry practices which made 
                    clear to me how these large products I had come to know in my life were 
                    initially created and maintained.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My goal now is to enter to the workforce, build upon my skills and learn more 
                    all while getting an opportunity to contribute to professional software, 
                    hopefully I'll get a chance to add a new exciting paragraph or two to this page 
                    too. My love for software and computers has certainly never gone away and as 
                    time goes on I'll certaintly keep looking for new things to learn and create, 
                    showcases of my projects can be found on the <a href="#"> projects </a> page
